## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated violet (#9400D3), evoking intelligence and creativity, yet also trendy and attention-grabbing. This color symbolizes WaizMarco's brilliance. Do not use teal!
- Background color: Very light, desaturated violet (#F0E5F5), providing a soft and clean backdrop for the primary violet, while emphasizing content and improving readability.
- Accent color: Analogous blue-violet (#483D8B), used sparingly to draw the user's attention to the areas that need it the most.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headlines, body font: 'Inter', giving a cutting-edge and scientifically serious feel. Use 'Source Code Pro' for code blocks.
- Minimalist and modern icons that are easily recognizable and complement the overall clean design.
- Clean and structured layout with clear visual hierarchy, ensuring ease of navigation and readability across devices.
- Subtle and smooth animations to enhance user interaction and provide visual feedback without being distracting.
